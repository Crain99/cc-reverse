## [Unreleased]

### Added (PR 2, Wave 1)
- R5: CCON v2 (notepack) decoder — `.cconb` files at version 2 now produce real documents.
- R6: Full IPackedFileData rehydrate — multi-section packs are split and each section rehydrated.
- R7: TypedArray DataTypeID coverage in rehydrate (DataTypeID 13 + 14, 9 ctors).
- R8: Cross-bundle redirect resolution — assets routed via `cfg.redirect` now read from the dep bundle.
- Validate gates: `cconV2`, `typedArrays`.

### Added (PR 1, Wave 0)
- R1: JSC key extraction now scans `application.js`, `cocos-js/*.js`, `src/settings.json`; supports byte-array key form (`xxteaKey = [0x.., ...]`).
- R3: All 3.x hot-path sync IO replaced with `fs/promises` and guarded by a unit test.
- R4: Per-asset error isolation in `engine3x.unpackBundle`; emits `RECOVERY_REPORT.md` to output root with `ok / failed / missed` counts per bundle.
- vitest test scaffold (replaces jest); `npm run validate <output-dir>` quality-gate runner.
